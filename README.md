# ITS GRAVY : portfolio

This is my portfolio, created quickly to find an internship and a job. Now, I am making major improvements to ensure a better experience.

I am new to this field but I am always fully engaged. I am unsure whether I will pursue freelance work or become an employee. I want to work on projects and collaborate with other developers with diverse skills to learn more. I enjoy challenges. My goal is to ensure that the new design will help me find partners.
